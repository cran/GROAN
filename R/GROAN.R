#' Dummy function for import management
#'
#' This function allows to have a single place where to place all the generic @import.
#' Usually only a couple are required, but for things used all over the places (like stats package)
#' there is no real single place where to put the import. It's cleaner in this way.
#'
#' @return nothing
#' @keywords internal
#' @import stats
#' @import utils
